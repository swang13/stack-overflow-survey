## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to answer the following questions:

1. Which counties embrace work from home most?
2. Does Work From Home impact job satisfication?
3. How likely is a developer to be working from home, considering the characteristics of both the employer and employee?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one iPython notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The Data folder contains the survey data used by this analysis.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]().

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Credits must be given to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).
