## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to answer the following questions:

1. Which counties embrace work from home most?
2. Does Work From Home impact job satisfication?
3. How to find a work from home developer job?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one iPython notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The Data folder contains the survey data used by this analysis.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

1. The top five countries with the highest proportion of work from home developers are Iran, Pakistan, Czech Republic, Ukraine, and Russian Federation.
2. We are more than 99.9% sure that the work from home developers have better job satisfaction ratings than the ones who commute.
3. These factors tend to lead to a work from home job:

 * Jobs in Iran, Pakistan, Ukraine, etc.
 * Part-time developers
 * Pre-series A startup companies
 * Developers who are more serious about work

The main findings of the code can also be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@wangshuocugb2005/want-to-become-a-work-from-home-developer-e0d1a8407193).
